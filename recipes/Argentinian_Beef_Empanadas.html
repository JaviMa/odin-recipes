            <h2><em>Description</em></h2>

            <p>This recipe highlights the rich diversity of empanadas in Argentina, a beloved dish found throughout Latin America and Spain. Developed by Gaby Melian, a former test kitchen manager in Buenos Aires, these empanadas are a product of her family's culinary heritage. Gaby, who learned the art of empanada-making from her mother and grandmother, opts for a baked version using store-bought empanada dough (a type of puff pastry) for a delightfully flaky texture. In her own words, this homemade empanada recipe has become a reliable go-to for various occasions, from birthday parties to unexpected guests. Freezer-friendly for up to three months, these empanadas offer a convenient solution, with Gaby emphasizing the versatility and practicality of having them on hand. Whether baked or fried, empanadas hold a special place in Argentine cuisine and beyond.</p>

            <h3><em>Preparation</em></h3>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Step</strong></li>
                <p>Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large pot over high. Cook <strong> 2 lb. ground beef,</strong> breaking up with a spoon, until browned but not completely cooked through, 6 - 8 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl with a slotted spoon, leaving as much fat in pan as possible.</p>

                <li>Step</li>
                <p>Reduce heat to medium and cook <strong>2 medium onions,</strong> chopped, <strong>2 small red bell peppers,</strong> seeded, chopped, and remaining <strong>1 Tbsp. oil,</strong> stirring, until tender but not browned, 6–8 minutes; season with <strong>salt</strong> and <strong>black pepper.</strong> Add <strong>3 Tbsp. ground cumin, 2 Tbsp. sweet paprika, 1 Tbsp. dried oregano,</strong> and <strong>¼ tsp. cayenne pepper</strong> and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add <strong>1½ cups low-sodium chicken stock or broth</strong> and reserved beef along with any accumulated juices to pot. Stir in <strong>2 tsp. sugar, 4 tsp. salt,</strong> and <strong>¼ tsp. black pepper.</strong> Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring and scraping up any brown bits, until most of the liquid is evaporated, 15–20 minutes; taste and season with salt and black pepper, if needed. Stir in ½ <strong>cup raisins.</strong> Transfer to a medium bowl, cover, and chill at least 3 hours.</p>
                <p><strong>Do Ahead:</strong> Beef filling can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.</p>

                <li><strong>Step</strong></li>
                <p>Preheat oven to 375°. Let <strong>3 packages Puff Pastry Dough for Empanadas</strong> sit at room temperature 15 minutes to temper. Remove 6 rounds from package, keeping plastic divider underneath, and arrange on a work surface. Place 2 Tbsp. filling in the center of each round.</p>

                <li><strong>Step</strong></li>
                <p>Top with <strong>2 olive halves.</strong> Brush water around half of outer edge of each round.</p>

                <li><strong>Step</strong></li>
                <p>Using plastic divider to help you, fold round over filling and pinch edges to seal.</p>

                <li><strong>Step</strong></li>
                <p>Using a fork, crimp edges. Remove plastic and transfer empanada to a parchment-lined sheet tray, spacing 1" apart. Repeat with remaining rounds (you’ll get about 12 empanadas on each tray).</p>

                <li><strong>Step</strong></li>
                <p>Bake empanadas, rotating tray halfway through, until golden brown and slightly darker around the edges, 25–35 minutes.</p>
                <p><strong>Do Ahead:</strong> Unbaked empanadas can be made 3 months ahead; freeze on sheet tray, then transfer to freezer bags and keep frozen.</p>
            </ol>
